#### About the repo name
Forgive for the unimaginitive naming of this repo. It is only meant to be my playground for writing and practising algorithms written in Go.

### What you can find in this repo
Most of these snippets are practise work for [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) problems.
I will try and provide links for the individual problems where I can.


Please feel free to look around, copy anything you might find interesting or fork the whole thing if you want.
